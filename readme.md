This folder contains the code to analyze for the paper 'Interpreting the structure of multi-object representations in vision encoders'

The three folders constrain the experiments done in the paper.

1) Paired Object Tasks: This folder contains the main experiments of the paper
2) Global Probe: This folder contains the global 20-class probe designed to understand baseline information about token object categories. This also contains object decoding taks comparing avg_obj and random_obj tokens to CLS tokens and zero-shot performance for CLIP.
3) Similarity maps generation for an individual image's token to other tokens in the image.

The plots for individual models are given in the pdf named 'Supplementary material XAI.pdf'
